# Set up VPN access to your home network from outside

There are many possibilities for making your home network accessible from the outside world:

* Subscribe to a networking-as-a-service provider, e.g. ZeroTier or Tailscale
* Put your server on a Raspberry Pi, e.g. using the PiVPN script
* Buy a small business router that supports VPN server functionality
* At a pinch, you can use an ordinary Windows PC as a VPN server.

The Windows PC option can be complicated and fiddly.

## WireGuard server on a Windows PC

For WireGuard, Henry Chang has pioneered using the Windows WireGuard client as a WireGuard server. He has documented his approach at [https://www.henrychang.ca/how-to-setup-wireguard-vpn-server-on-windows[(https://www.henrychang.ca/how-to-setup-wireguard-vpn-server-on-windows). Micah Morrison turned this method into a desktop tool at [https://github.com/micahmo/WgServerforWindows](https://github.com/micahmo/WgServerforWindows).

## OpenVPN server on a Windows PC

Installing and configuring an OpenVPN server on a home PC running Windows is probably the most complicated option. What follows is a summary, in English, of the instructions at [https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/527300861](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/527300861).

Router steps:

1. Open your router firewall for `udp/1194` input
2. Port forward `udp/1194` on your router to your `udp/1194` on your Windows PC

Windows steps:

1. Set up a Windows power plan so that your PC will not be asleep when you try to VPN home
2. If you don't have a fixed IP at home, subscribe to a dynamic DNS service such as [https://www.noip.com](https://www.noip.com)
3. In Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security, add a new rule allowing `udp/1194` input
4. Install OpenVPN on your Windows PC
5. Generate the Public Key Infrastructure with EasyRSA and EasyTLS
6. Create your server configuration file
