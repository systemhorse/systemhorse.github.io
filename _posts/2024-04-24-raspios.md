# Shadowsocks Client on Raspberry Pi OS

This post shows you how to install a Shadowsocks command-line client on Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit Debian 11).

Check that you have Shadowsocks in your Raspberry Pi's repositories. Open a terminal emulator and issue the command:

```shell
apt-cache search shadowsocks
```

Assuming you see `shadowsocks-libev`, install it as follows:

```shell
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

```shell
sudo apt install shadowsocks-libev -y
```

When you install the `shadowsocks-libev` package, it automatically creates a systemd service defined in `/usr/lib/systemd/system/shadowsocks-libev.service` and referring to the configuration file `/etc/shadowsocks-libev/config.json`.

Edit `/usr/lib/systemd/system/shadowsocks-libev.service` using your favorite text editor, such as `vi` or `nano`. Remember that you'll need to prefix your edit command with `sudo` to edit system files:

```shell
sudo nano /usr/lib/systemd/system/shadowsocks-libev.service
```

Change the systemd service file to invoke `ss-local` instead of `ss-server`:

```shell
ExecStart=/usr/bin/ss-local -c $CONFFILE $DAEMON_ARGS
```

Save the systemd service file. (You'll reload systemd in a moment.)

Edit the configuration file `/etc/shadowsocks-libev/config.json` to match your server. Again, remember that you'll need to prefix your edit command with `sudo` to edit system files:

```shell
sudo nano /etc/shadowsocks-libev/config.json
```

Insert contents modeled on the following, replacing `123.123.123.123` by your actual server IP address, and substituting in the actual port number and password for your Shadowsocks server: 

```json
{
  "server": "123.123.123.123",
  "server_port": 8388,
  "local_address": "127.0.0.1",
  "local_port": 1080,
  "password": "S2T5o0rS1ewcw3VcDdqMqmUlz3rfIekW",
  "method": "chacha20-ietf-poly1305",
  "timeout": 300,
  "fast_open": false
}
```

The parameters you choose on the client must match those on the server.

After you've finished editing, save the configuration file `/etc/shadowsocks-libev/config.json`.

Reload systemd:

```shell
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

Restart the Shadowsocks service:

```shell
sudo systemctl restart shadowsocks-libev
```

Check that `shadowsocks-libev` is running:

```shell
sudo systemctl status shadowsocks-libev
```

![sudo systemctl status shadowsocks-libev](/assets/images/raspios-4.png)

Do **q** on your computer keyboard to quit the status listing.

Now open **Preferences** > **Add/Remove Software**. Install Mozilla Firefox ESR.

Open Firefox. Under the hamburger menu, go to **Settings** > **Network Settings**.

Set **Manual proxy configuration**, SOCKS Host `127.0.0.1`, Port `1080`, **SOCKS v5**, **Proxy DNS when using SOCKS v5**. Click **OK**.

![Manual proxy configuration, SOCKS Host 127.0.0.1, Port 1080, SOCKS v5, Proxy DNS when using SOCKS v5](/assets/images/raspios-5.png)

Now browse the web using your Shadowsocks proxy server.

When you are done, set the network back to **Use system proxy settings**. You can leave the `shadowsocks-libev` service running in the background until you next need it.

(If you want to use Chromium instead of Firefox, it may be possible to add a line `http_proxy=socks5h://127.0.0.1:1080` in the file `/etc/environment`. This has not been tested.)
